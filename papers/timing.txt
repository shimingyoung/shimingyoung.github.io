Road traffic sensors provide us with rich multi--variable datastreams 
about the current traffic conditions. Occasionally, there are unusual traffic 
events (such as accidents, jams, severe weather, etc) that disrupt the expected 
road traffic conditions. Detecting the occurrence of such events in an online and 
real-time manner is useful to drivers in planning their routes and in the management of
 the transportation infrastructure.

We propose a new method for detecting traffic events that impact road traffic conditions
by extending the Bayesian Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) approach.
Our method couples multiple traffic datastreams so that they
share a certain sparse structure.
This sparse structure is used to localize traffic events in space and time.
The traffic datastreams are measurements of different physical quantities (e.g. traffic flow, road occupancy) 
by different nearby sensors.
Our proposed method process datastreams in an incremental way with little computational cost,
and hence it is suitable to detect events in an online and real-time manner.

We experimentally analyze the detection performance of the proposed coupled Bayesian RPCA using real data from
loop detectors on the Minnesota I--494. We find that our method significantly improves the detection accuracy
when compared with the traditional PCA and non--coupled Bayesian RPCA.
